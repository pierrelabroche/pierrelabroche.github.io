Collection of some of my academic and personal projects

Academic – CSElecs: This is my creative project for Stanford's CS109: Probability for Computer Scientists. 
Created in December 2022, this project is a conceptual application of the 
machine learning algorithm Naive-Bayes. The goal is to help Stanford students with
picking CS electives, specifically CS students. First, a student will list all
the CS electives they have taken, along with whether they liked/disliked
each of the classes. Then, the Naive-Bayes algorithm determines the probability 
of liking another CS elective. At least this is the idea; the data needed to make this project
accurate would require approval and support from the Stanford CS department in query students
in each CS class offered. Thus, it's currently just a concept and fun probability generator to 
play with:

Personal - Space Invaders:
If you have never played, is a retro arcade game that our great, great...great
grandparents used to play. After learning how to code through javascript, HTML, and CSS in high school, 
I created this web version of said retro game. You have a spaceship at the bottom
of the screen that you control and aliens above who are coming towards you slowly. You need to shoot
all the aliens before they hit the bottom to win. It serves as a major milestone in my CS journey 
and a fun game to play! Give it a try here:

Personal - Car Game:
This is my first game I have coded. It is a simple game that I am extremely 
happy I managed to create. You are an orange car at the bottom of the screen and you have red
cars that are randomly generated and racing down at you. You are trying to avoid as many red 
cars as you can before you crash into one and lose. What's the catch? Every 7 cars you dodge, 
the speed of all the cars increases. Sounds fun? Check it out here:
